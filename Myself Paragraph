Hello, my name is Aric Hoang. I attented Institue of Technology at Central Syracuse. My hobbies mainly consist of doing art, watching sports, and playing basketball. I like to be creative and draw whatever is on my mind whenever I have freetime and want to relax a bit and relieve some stress. I like talking about sports with people, my favorite teams are the Denver Broncos (football) and the Houston Rockets (basketball). Speaking of basketball, whenever I want to exercise I like to play basketball to accomplish that. It's a good way to gey my body moving while also having fun. Other things I like to do is going out with friends, mainly going to movies or doing fun things together like bowling or pick up basketball.
